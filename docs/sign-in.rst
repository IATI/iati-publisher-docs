Adding other people from your organisation to IATI Publisher
----------------------------------------
If you are a new user from an organisation that is already using IATI Publisher, an admin user from your organisation can create an account for you.

They can do this via the `Users page <https://publisher.iatistandard.org/users/>`_, while signed in. Individuals can be added, removed or edited by anyone with "admin" level permissions in your organisation.

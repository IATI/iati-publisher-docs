Organisation data
###################

The IATI data standard includes two types of data file - organisation and activity. The organisation data file includes information such as your organisation’s unique identifier, future-looking budgets, total expenditure and links to reports or strategy documents. 

In IATI Publisher, you must publish organisation data before you can publish activity data. You can start with the basic (“core”) elements and add more information over time.

You will be prompted to review and publish organisation data in the 'Get Started' guide.

Editing organisation data
-------------------------
You can view or edit your organisation data from IATI Publisher's Organisation Data page.

Some of these data elements are mandatory to populate and are labelled “core” (with a yellow ring symbol). Other elements are optional and can be populated if relevant.

You can search elements by name or filter on completion status.


Publishing organisation data
----------------------------

1. Ensure that core elements have been completed on the Organisation Data page
2. Click “Publish” in the top right of the screen
3. Click “Continue” after core element completeness has been checked
4. Publication of your organisation data will be confirmed

You can edit information on the Organisation Data page at any time to update what you have published. After any changes, you will see the option to “Republish” in the top right.

You need to publish organisation data in IATI Publisher before you can publish activity data. Once published, you can edit, add to and republish your organisation data at any time.

Default values
###################

You can populate default values in IATI Publisher’s settings so that the information is automatically applied elsewhere in your data. 

We strongly recommend that you populate your default language and currency. There are other recommended default values that are often required by different `donor governments’ IATI requirements <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/standard-overview/donors-reporting-requirements/>`_.

You will be prompted to complete default values in Step 2 of the 'Get Started' guide. after you first sign in.

Changing your default values
----------------------------
You can view or edit your default values in IATI Publisher's `Settings <https://publisher.iatistandard.org/setting>`_.

*Recommended defaults for activity data* are fields commonly required by funders, who may provide specific advice on how to complete them. Use the question mark icons to view more information on each field. The default values you have entered will be automatically applied to any activities that you create in IATI Publisher. 

You can change these values for an individual activity by clicking 'Override this activity’s default values' in the top-right of the activity detail screen.

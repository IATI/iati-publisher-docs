Which import template should I use?
###################################

IATI Publisher has activity import templates in CSV and XLSX file format. If you are uploading results data (i.e. results, indicators and periods for existing activities), you will need to use the XLSX import. If you are uploading basic activity data, which can include budgets and transactions, you can choose between the CSV and XLSX imports.

CSV template
------------
IATI Publisher has a single CSV import template, which covers all elements of the IATI Standard for activities apart from `results <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/>`_.

This template is recommended if you:

- want to work in a single flat file, rather than a workbook with multiple sheets
- don't need embedded codelists or dropdown menus to enter your data


XLSX templates
---------------
There are four templates available on the `XLSX import page <https://publisher.iatistandard.org/import/xls>`_:

1. Basic Activity Data - covers core and optional IATI data elements for activities, including transactions
2. Results - to import `results <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/>`_ for existing activities
3. Indicators - to import `indicators <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/>`_ for existing results
4. Periods - to import `periods <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/>`_ for existing indicators

These templates are recommended if you:

- prefer to work in a workbook that has multiple sheets (typically one per element of the IATI Standard)
- find embedded codelists and dropdown menus helpful for entering your data
- need help distinguishing between elements of the IATI Standard that require a single entry (e.g. activity status), versus those that accept multiple entries (e.g. budget)

Only one template can be uploaded at a time. It is normally recommended to `export existing activity data <https://docs.publisher.iatistandard.org/en/latest/bulk-import/#exporting-your-existing-data>`_ before adding to it via the import functionality.

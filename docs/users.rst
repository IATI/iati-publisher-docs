Users

.. attention:: 
   IATI Publisher's "Users" page was removed in December 2025 as part of the switch to IATI single sign-on. To view or edit the users associated with your organisation's account, visit IATI Account.

IATI Account's `Users page <>`_ lists all individuals in your organisation that have an account. Anyone with admin level permissions can add, edit or remove users.

User permissions
----------------
There are three permission levels in IATI Account - "Admins", "Editors" and "Contributors". `Read more about these different levels <>`_.

"Contributors" cannot edit their organisation name or type in IATI Publisher. There are no restrictions on what "Admins" or "Editors" can do in IATI Publisher.

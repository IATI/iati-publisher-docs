.. attention:: 
   IATI Publisher's "Users" page was removed in December 2025 as part of the switch to IATI single sign-on. To view or edit the users associated with your organisation's account, visit IATI Account.

IATI Account's Users page lists all individuals in your organisation that have an account. Anyone with admin level permissions can add, edit or remove users.

User permissions
----------------
There are three permission levels in IATI Account - "Admins", "Editors" and "Contributors". `Read more about these different levels <https://docs.account.iatistandard.org/en/latest/manage_organisation_users/>`_.

"Contributors" cannot edit their organisation name or type in IATI Publisher. There are no restrictions on what "Admins" or "Editors" can do in IATI Publisher.

Users
#####

IATI Publisher's `Users page <https://publisher.iatistandard.org/users/>`_ lists all individuals in your organisation that have an account. Anyone with admin level permissions can add, edit or remove users from this page. 

Adding or removing user accounts
--------------------------------
To add a new user, you will need to enter their full name, email address and user type (see information on user permissions below). You will also create a password for them, which they should change after signing in for the first time.


User permissions
----------------
There are two types of user accounts on IATI Publisher - admins and general users. Admins have the highest level of permission for your organisation.

**Admin users can:**

* Add other users to their organisation (setting them as 'co-admins' or 'general users')
* Add, edit and publish activity data
* Add, edit and publish organisation data
* Edit settings such as default values and your organisation's identifiers


**General users can:**

* View, but not edit or add, other users for their organisation
* Add, edit and publish activity data
* View, but not edit or publish, organisation data
* View, but not edit, settings

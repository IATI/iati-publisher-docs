Basic activity data
###################

The IATI data standard includes two types of data file - organisation and activity. The activity file includes information on the activities that your organisation carries out, such as your projects or humanitarian interventions. The IATI Standard includes data fields on what the activity is, where it is taking place, which organisations are involved and how it is financed.

Creating a new activity
--------------------------------
Most users will create activities manually in the interface, by entering information about the activity in IATI Publisher's data entry forms. If you want to add multiple activities at once, see the section on `bulk importing <https://docs.publisher.iatistandard.org/en/latest/bulk-import/>`_.


Core elements
-------------
Some IATI data elements are labelled “core” and have a yellow ring symbol against them.

It is recommended that you complete “core” elements. They are either mandatory according to the IATI Standard or required by most `donor governments’ publishing requirements <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/standard-overview/donors-reporting-requirements/>`_.

Other elements are optional. You are still encouraged to populate as many optional fields as you can, however, as this makes your data more useful to IATI's data users. 


Editing an activity
-------------------
Click on each data element in the left hand menu of the activity page to add your data.

Mandatory fields are marked with a red asterisk (*) and are displayed towards the top of IATI Publisher’s data entry forms. These fields should always be populated to avoid errors in your published data. 

Optional fields are displayed in collapsed format towards the bottom of data entry forms. Use the arrow icons to expand and collapse these sections as needed.


Publishing activity data
------------------------
Activities can be published in bulk from the activity list page or individually from the activity detail page. If the activity has been edited since it was published, you will see the option to “Republish”. Republishing is necessary to update your public data.


Unpublishing activity data
--------------------------
Once published, IATI activities should remain public even after they have finished. You can update and republish your activity data as often as needed, for example to update budgets or end dates.

In some cases, however, activity data needs to be removed from public view. To do this, you can 'unpublish' your activity in IATI Publisher.

To delete an activity from the IATI Publisher interface, select its checkbox in the activity list then click on the trash can icon next to 'Add Activity'. Deleting permanently removes the activity from IATI Publisher. You will be asked to unpublish the activity first, if applicable.

Basic activity data
###################

The second type of IATI data file is the activity file. This includes information on the activities that your organisation carries out, such as your projects or humanitarian interventions. The IATI Standard includes data fields on what the activity is, where it is taking place, which organisations are involved and how it is financed.

Creating a new activity
--------------------------------
You can create activities individually in the IATI Publisher interface and enter information via data entry forms. If you want to add multiple activities at once, see the section on bulk importing.

Budgets and transactions
###################

Budgets are for each financial quarter (or year) over the lifetime of an activity. They are useful to give recipient countries predictability of funding and to inform their planning.

Transactions are a record of the incoming or outgoing funds for an activity. They have a date (in the past), value, provider organisation and recipient organisation.

Add budgets or transactions one by one in IATI Publisher's data entry forms, or in bulk via the `bulk import functionality <https://docs.publisher.iatistandard.org/en/latest/bulk-import/>`_.

Adding budgets
--------------
Locate "budget" in the left hand menu of elements for your activity. You can add as many budgets as you need in the data entry form, noting that each budget period should be no longer than one year.


Adding transactions
------------------------------------
Locate "transaction" in the activity element menu to open the relevant data entry form.

Some information can be provided at either activity or transaction level, but not both (e.g. sector, recipient country and recipient region). If you have already provided this information for the activity as a whole, the corresponding sections will be highlighted grey and not editable in the transaction data entry form.

The Transaction List is a way to view, search and edit all transactions added for your activity.

IATI Publisher
**************

`IATI Publisher <https://publisher.iatistandard.org/>`_ is an online tool for organisations that want to publish data on their development and humanitarian activities according to the IATI Standard. It is free and managed by the IATI Secretariat.

It is designed for:

* small to medium-sized organisations that have a limited amount of IATI data to publish (typically, this means less than 100 `IATI activities <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/standard-overview/activity-information/activity-defined/>`_) 
* entering data directly in the web interface via data entry forms

.. attention:: 
   While IATI Publisher has some bulk import functionality, it is not recommended for organisations that need to manage their data in external workbooks or other tools. Large organisations, such as donor governments or UN agencies, are advised not to use IATI Publisher for this reason.

Steps to publishing
-------------------
.. tip:: 
   For an overview of what data publishing involves, have a look at our page `How to publish data <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/publishing-data/publishing-checklist/>`_.

To use IATI Publisher, you will first need to register via IATI Account. You can then sign in to prepare and publish your data using IATI Publisher. 

IATI Publisher uses the `IATI Validator <https://validator.iatistandard.org/>`_ to check your data before you publish, providing feedback on validation errors against the IATI schema.

Help & Support
--------------

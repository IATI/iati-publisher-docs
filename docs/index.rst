IATI Publisher
******************

`IATI Publisher <https://publisher.iatistandard.org/>`_ is an online tool that enables organisations to publish data on their development and humanitarian activities according to the IATI Standard. It is free and managed by the IATI Secretariat.

IATI Publisher is designed for small to medium-sized organisations that have a limited amount of IATI data to publish. Typically, this refers to organisations with fewer than 100 IATI activities, who want to enter information via online data entry forms. An ‘activity’ is an individual programme, project or other unit of development and humanitarian work, which is determined by the organisation that is publishing the data.

Large organisations, such as donor governments or UN agencies are advised not to use IATI Publisher. These organisations will likely need an alternative publishing method that is more suitable for large volumes of data.

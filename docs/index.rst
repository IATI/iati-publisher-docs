IATI Publisher
******************

`IATI Publisher <https://publisher.iatistandard.org/>`_ is an online tool for organisations who want to publish data on their development and humanitarian activities according to the IATI Standard. It is free and managed by the IATI Secretariat.

IATI Publisher is designed for small to medium-sized organisations who have a limited amount of IATI data to publish. Typically, this refers to organisations that have fewer than 100 IATI activities. An ‘activity’ is an individual programme, project or other unit of development and humanitarian work, as defined by your organisation. 

Large organisations, such as donor governments or UN agencies, are advised not to use IATI Publisher. These organisations will likely need an alternative publishing method that is more suited to large volumes of data. 

Data is primarily entered into IATI Publisher via online data entry forms, with some functionality for bulk importing.

IATI Publisher
******************

`IATI Publisher <https://publisher.iatistandard.org/>`_ is a free online tool, managed by the IATI Secretariat, that enables organisations to publish data on their development and humanitarian activities according to the IATI Standard.

IATI Publisher is designed to support organisations that publish a limited number of development and humanitarian activities. An ‘activity’ is an individual project or another unit of development and humanitarian work, which is determined by the organisation that is publishing the data. Organisations who publish a limited number of activities tend to represent small and medium sized organisations.

Large organisations, such as donor governments or UN agencies delivering 100+ activities are advised not to use IATI Publisher. Instead these organisations likely need to develop another publishing method more suitable for large volumes of data.

Each result must have at least one indicator. This is a rule of the IATI Standard and should be followed to avoid errors in your published data.

Periods can be added to indicators to record their target and actual values over time. Periods are not essential to add to your indicators before publishing for the first time. A result can have multiple indicators, and each indicator can have multiple periods.

You can add indicators and periods from the activity detail page (Figure 1), or from the individual result page.

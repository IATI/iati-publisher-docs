Publishing settings
###################

If you signed up via the 'My organisation is new to IATI' registration route, your publishing settings will be automatically populated and you do can skip to the next section on Default Values.

If your organisation was previously registered with IATI, you will need to link your new IATI Publisher account to your account on the IATI Registry:

1) Generate an API token in your IATI Registry account
---------------------------------------------------

* Log in to the `IATI Registry <https://iatiregistry.org/publisher/>`_ (note - credentials for the IATI Registry are not the same as for IATI Publisher) 
* Click "My Account” in the top-right, then on the tab “API Tokens”
* Enter a name for the new token (this can be anything)
* Click “Create API token”
* Copy the API token string that appears at the top of the screen


2) Copy your API token to IATI Publisher
----------------------------------------

* Go to “Settings” in the IATI Publisher main menu
* Paste the API token copied from the IATI Registry into the “API token” box
* Click the “Verify” button to check your API Token. You will see either a green “Correct” label or a red “Incorrect” one
* Once your API token is correct, click on “Save Publishing Setting” to save your information

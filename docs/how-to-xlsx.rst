How do I complete the XLSX templates?
#########################################

If you are using IATI Publisher's XLSX templates, we recommend `exporting your existing data <https://docs.publisher.iatistandard.org/en/latest/bulk-import/#exporting-your-existing-data>`_ first, then editing it and re-importing the template.

The XLSX templates are split into sheets, which correspond to different data elements of the IATI Standard.

.. admonition:: Tips

   - Not all sheets need populating - focus on completing `core data elements <https://docs.publisher.iatistandard.org/en/latest/basic-activity-data/#core-elements>`_ first.
   - The 'Settings' sheet is only needed if you want to override your default values saved in IATI Publisher (i.e. for individual activities that you are importing).
   - If you are entering multiple values (e.g. transactions), enter these over multiple rows in the relevant sheet.
   - Don't edit sheet or column names, or change the order of columns in a sheet.
   - Don't make any edits to the 'Options' sheet.

Column colour-coding
"""""""""""""""""""""
Columns in the XLSX templates are colour-coded based on the number of row entries expected. Note that this only applies if you choose to populate the sheet. `Core elements <https://docs.publisher.iatistandard.org/en/latest/basic-activity-data/#core-elements>`_ are mandatory, whereas other sheets in the template are optional.

- Pink - column expects a single entry
- Green - column expects at least one entry, and multiple entries are allowed (e.g. for title narratives in multiple languages)
- Orange - column is optional and expects a single entry if you choose to complete it
- Blue - column is optional and can have multiple entries if you choose to complete it
